When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    Either when I want to collaborate with other people or I want to save a copy
    of precious projects online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    You might not want all the changes that other people have done to your
    remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    >> fork = a clone of someone else's repo as one of your own repo
    within GitHub itself
    >> clone = a copy of either a local or a GitHub repo on your own machine
    >> branch = a sequence of commits within the same repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
    You can always compare the current state of your own work against the remote
    state. This way, you won't make outdated decisions by accident.

How would you collaborate without using git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?
    I would probably use Google Drive. Collaborating would be much easier at
    first because all one has to do is open a Shared Folder and copy-paste
    things to the drive. But keeping track of file history and making sure that
    no one deletes things on accident would be much more difficult.
