When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    Either when I want to collaborate with other people or I want to save a copy
    of precious projects online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    You might not want all the changes that other people have done to your
    remote repository.
